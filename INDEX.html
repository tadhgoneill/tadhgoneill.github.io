# Valerie Background for Andy.

I met Valerie around the same time as I met Elisa, the German girl Omar fell for.
Val is German too and back then, both herself and Elisa and Vallo were working together as interns in Goethe Institute. At the time of writing, Val still is. She leaves to go back to Germany some time in October.

I first met her one night a big group of us went out to Whelan's for silent disco.
She struck me as rather nervy and to be honest after talking to her for a bit I got a sense that she was a bit clingy and I think I swerved her slightly as I felt like she might end up as my de-facto ward or something. 
After meeting her a couple more times though I thought she was cool and I think that night she just had this perception we were all cooler than her or something and she really wanted to fit it / make friends with people in Dublin.

A little while went by, that whole falling out thing with Omar happened after my birthday thing when I felt ditched for Elisa. Still didn't really know Val at this stage so she wasn't at my bday.
I can remember the moment Vallo and I properly bonded clearly - the day/night surrounding it is fuzzy though. 

## MD Night No.1 - Saturday, 4th May 2025.

I think as a group we'd planned a big MD, out and about dancey night. I was tasked with securing the drugs. I was meeting the college lads (Drooy, Tom, Johnny, Gary, John) in the early evening in that sports bar by Cineworld Parnell - so I told the dealer I could meet him there. Got 100 quid out the ATM for two baggies, took a pic of my outfit to send him and waited.
He pulled up, and I hopped in. Your man was Brazilian and super chill with it. There happened to be a squad car behind us just as we pulled off but your man kept a super cool head. He said "Your stuff is on the centre console there, I just don't wanna be seen handing you something."
I asked him if he wanted me to count out the money, cos it came in 20s and 10s and he said "nah you're all good, just leave it there." glancing at the two bags of MD.
He asked me what I was up to now, and I said I was just about to grab a few drinks with my mates up the road, so he said he'd drop me there. Fucking sound.
Anyway, let's speed this up and get to Vallo. 
Headed in and said hello to the lads, told them I'd just done my first drug deal and it was class. Then I went to the loo to sort myself out cos the baggies were just loose in my pocket and I wanted to put them in my keyring thing.
As I was in the stall, I put the toilet lid down as I could just see myself dropping them in the loo. As I did though, I spotted a ~~10c~~ 20c coin sitting there behind the lid, loaded with white powder mystery drugs. Presumably coke.
Considered it for a moment and then scooped it into the smaller keyring of the two for later lol. So dodgy.
Anyway, had some food and a few scoops with the lads then headed off. I was v aware that there was a whole gang of people that at that moment were pre-drinking at Elisa's that were waiting for their drug order to arrive.

I'm including some videos of their pre-drinks so you can get a mental image haha ðŸ‘‡
